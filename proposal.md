My new proposaI is to analyze and predict dividend per share (DPS) among publicly listed firms within a specific industry, using financial statement data obtained through the stockanalysis or yahoo. The objective is to evaluate how effectively working capital dynamics explain dividend levels compared to broader financial indicators.
 
The analysis will be based on two models:
a baseline model, using only working capital–related variables (working capital and its variation); and
a comprehensive model, which includes additional financial indicators such as profitability, leverage, cash flow, and firm size.
 
Both econometric (panel and multiple regressions) and machine learning approaches (Random Forest) will be applied to predict future dividends and assess the relative importance of each variable group. This design will make it possible to quantify how much working capital alone contributes to dividend predictions and whether its influence remains significant once other financial factors are considered.
 
Please let me know if this project would be appropriate for the course. If not, I’ll be happy to explore another idea that better fits the course objectives.
 
Best regards,
Adis
